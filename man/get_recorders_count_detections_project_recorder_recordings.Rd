\description{
Wrapper around the 'aggregations_project_recorders_count_detections_project_recorder_recordings' endpoint to retrieve a count of detections for each recorder and grouped by recording.

\examples{
# Retrieve a count of detections for each ecoPi at each recording. (Project x , with 3 ecoPi'S is scheduled to record at 10 times per day. I want to extract a count of detections for each ecoPi and each scheduled recording session )
